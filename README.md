# 🛡️ My Security Blog
Welcome to my personal security blog — a space where I document and share my journey in cybersecurity. This blog is a growing archive of my hands-on experiences, technical deep dives, and continuous learning across various areas in the field, including:

🔍 Capture The Flag (CTF) walkthroughs

🛠️ Tool reviews and usage guides

📚 Notes from courses, certifications, and research

⚙️ Real-world analysis of vulnerabilities, exploits, and threat reports

🧠 Reflections on lessons learned through practical experimentation

🎯 Purpose
The primary goal of this blog is to solidify my own understanding while contributing back to the community. Whether I’m reverse engineering a binary, decoding a steganographic challenge, or exploring new tools like Wireshark, Suricata, or Burp Suite, I strive to explain concepts clearly and practically.

This blog also serves as a living portfolio to demonstrate:

My technical progression in cybersecurity

My commitment to self-education and problem-solving

My ability to communicate technical knowledge to others

👨‍💻 Who It's For
Security professionals and peers who enjoy sharing knowledge and war stories

Recruiters looking to understand my hands-on experience and growth in the field

Students or career changers who may benefit from practical breakdowns of complex concepts
