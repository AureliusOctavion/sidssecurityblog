# 🛡️ My Security Blog

Welcome to my personal security blog — a space where I document and share my journey in cybersecurity. This blog is a growing archive of my hands-on experiences, technical deep dives, and continuous learning across various areas in the field, including:

- 🔍 Capture The Flag (CTF) walkthroughs  
- 🛠️ Tool reviews and usage guides  
- 📚 Notes from courses, certifications, and research  
- ⚙️ Real-world analysis of vulnerabilities, exploits, and threat reports  
- 🧠 Reflections on lessons learned through practical experimentation

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this blog is to **solidify my own understanding** while **contributing back to the community**. Whether I’m reverse engineering a binary, decoding a steganographic challenge, or exploring new tools like Wireshark, Suricata, or Burp Suite, I strive to explain concepts clearly and practically.

This blog also serves as a **living portfolio** to demonstrate:

- My technical progression in cybersecurity  
- My commitment to self-education and problem-solving  
- My ability to communicate technical knowledge to others

## 👨‍💻 Who It's For

- **Security professionals** and peers who enjoy sharing knowledge and war stories  
- **Recruiters** looking to understand my hands-on experience and growth in the field  
- **Students or career changers** who may benefit from practical breakdowns of complex concepts
